# Cognitive Hearing Engine with Chess Kinematics (CHECK)
This project aims to provide the physically impaired with a simple and satisfying method of
playing chess with physical pieces. The system will mimic cnc machines like 3D printers to provide
swift and precise movement of pieces in all three axes. Voice commands will be the primary
method of controlling the machine to ensure a wide range of players can enjoy the game of
chess. In addition to piece movement, the system will be capable of overseeing the state of the
game to enforce the correct movement of pieces and game ending scenarios. By the completion
of this capstone project, the goal is to have developed an easy to use system that any two people
can play an entire game of chess with. Furthermore, with the addition of voice commands and
the automated movement of pieces, this project aspires to bring new life and accessibility to the
game of chess.
